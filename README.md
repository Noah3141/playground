# A Repo For Exploring the Basics of Rust

### I've tried to make a repo that:

1.  Gives you an example of a complex crate structure, while explaining how it is linked up.
1.  Provides readable code examples to learn all the basic programming tasks, like reading, writing, http requests, servers, and basic manipulations of text data.
1.  Uses minimal scope adjustments so that you can familiarize yourself with which namespaces contain what.
1.  Is set up for easily trying out the code examples in `main.rs`

## Questions You May Have

> What is the difference between all these `std::fs` and `std::io` options?

`std::io` tackles more complicated data types and possibilities, while `std::fs` is better for basic tasks of reading, writing, and saving to file system.

> Why would I ever want to read something in bytes?
