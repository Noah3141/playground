# A Repo For Exploring the Basics of Rust

I've tried to make a repo that:

-   Gives you an example of a complex crate structure, while explaining how it is linked up.
-   Provides readable code examples to learn all the basic programming tasks, like reading, writing, http requests, servers, and basic manipulations of text data.
-   Uses minimal scope adjustments so that you can familiarize yourself with which namespaces contain what.
-   Is set up for easily trying out the code examples in _main.rs_

## Questions You May Have

    What is the difference between all these std::fs and std::io options?

    std::io tackles more complicated data types and possibilities, while std::fs is better for basic tasks of reading, writing, and saving to file system.
