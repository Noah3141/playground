The idea is desaturated pink-red: Rose
Thick stark black outlines give a cell-shaded/tattoo look

desaturated yellow and green come in as accent colors

Basic backings are a cloud-white and stormcloud-grey

A dark red maroon comes in to aid in darker shades,
offering large spaces of red for dark-theme sections
